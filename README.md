## Monty Hall Problem 
### Monty Hall problem was a paradox or dillema that originated from an American show "Let's make a deal" and got its name from game show host Monty Hall . I solved the paradox using python code . Learn more about the paradox below . 
### We have 3 doors , door 1 , door 2 and door 3 . At the start we pick one of the doors . Behind one of the doors there is a car while behind other two doors are goats . After our pick the show host Monty Hall opens one of the doors which have a goat behind them . Monty Hall will never 1. open the door we picked and 2. open a door which has a car behind them . After that , we have a choice , either stay at door we picked or switch to remaining door . Paradox comes from the question "Should you switch?" and would you have higher odds of winning a car if you did . A short answer is yes with odds of 66.6% but if you want to learn more about this problem you can visit [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
